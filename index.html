    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <p>

        Finding working 3d objects was challenging. <br>
        Couldn't figure out how to manage the font size of text holder. <br>
        Isntead of removing each object, the custmoer will be placed at below the <br>ground and every time I need one of them, using setY(), I lifted up. <br>
        There's a invisible plane which is hitbox of customer, which allows the user to figure out what they want. <br>
        The speech bubble, or dialogue box is not made yet but it will be displayed and help the user know what to cook. <br>
        Amazing artwork by teammates <br>
        Now we have to work on the interactions <br>
